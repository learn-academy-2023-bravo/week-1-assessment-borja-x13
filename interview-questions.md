# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

Your answer: it is a way to make a decision based on comparative actions between two or more parameters, such as equality or lack thereof.  

Researched answer:

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

Your answer: git is an open source, version control program that is used in collaborative environments; most often in software developments, but can be used for other files that are not coding related, so it is also used by book authors and others. 

git: resides in your local computer and accessed via the terminal (on MacOS).
github: is a web application that uses github to make git easy to use as a collaborative tool by maintaining git repositories in the cloud and making them accessible within teams, organizations, or just the greater public. 

Researched answer: git is a free and open source version control system (https://git-scm.com/). Git itself is small and fast. Git and Github serve the same function except that Github serves as a cloud repoository as well. So git and github work together. 

2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value? 

Your answer: conditional operators such as ==, ===, >, < 

Researched answer: The three types of conditional operators: equality operators, logical operators, and relational operators. (bravo-lecture-  examples/javascript-conditionals.js)

3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

Your answer: it is the address of a value within an object. A value is what is contained within that address. So given the array["hello","world","what","is","up?"] the address for "hello" is index 0 of the array, and conversely if you look at array[0] you will get "hello" as the value contained within.

Researched answer: An index property is read-only and represents the position of a regular expression within an object.

4. Compare and contrast arrays and strings. Please include ways in which they are the same and ways in which they are different.

Your answer: a string is an object composed of characters and defined by being enclosed within "" marks. An array is an object composed other objects and defined by being enclosed in [] brackets, while the objects within are separated by commas. 

Researched answer: the biggest difference between an array and a string is that an array is a data structure and a string is an object. Arrays are mutable but strings are not and arrays can hold mulptiple data types but strings can only hold characters. 

5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

Your answer: during pair programming we have a "driver" who is doing the actual typing and one or more "navigators" that are dictating to the driver. It is collaborative, and both the driver and navigator/s contribute to the work dynamically. This also allows for a second set of eyes to find typos, and to come up with multiple ways in which to solve challenges. 

Researched answer: it is a software development technique where two programmers (driver and navigator) review each line of code as it is being typed. They switch ofter and cooperate in deciding direction and coming up with ideas. 

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions: Higher order functions are functions that can accept other functions as parameters and/or return a function.

2. Jest: Jest is a testing framework for JavaScript.

3. Objects: Objects in JavaScript are a data type that are containers for name:value pairs

4. Method: Methods are ways to interact with an object to modify it or get information from it.

5. Classes: Classes are functions that serve as a template for Objects.
